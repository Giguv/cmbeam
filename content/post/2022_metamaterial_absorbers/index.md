date: 2020-12-01

Our groups receives funding from the Swedish National Space Agency to develop novel metamaterial absorbers for future satellite missions studying the cosmic microwave background. This work will build on a great idea developed by our colleagues in the US (see link to paper below). In this work, we will design and print complex three-dimensional structures that absorb mm-wavelength radiation and test those using a holographic reflectometry system that is currently being developed here at SU.
