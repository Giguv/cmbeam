In November 2022, Nadia and Alexandre went to Tokyo as part of the CMB-INFLATE research network. Nadia was there for two weeks and Alexandre for a full month. They were hosted by Tomotake Matsumara's CMB research group at IPMU in Kashiwa. While there, Nadia worked with one of the post-docs on developping ideas about beam chromaticity, and Alexandre did simulations for the LiteBIRD HWP.
